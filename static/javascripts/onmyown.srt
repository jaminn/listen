1
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,560
There's gotta be another way out
I've been stuck in a cage with my doubt

2
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,900
I've tried forever getting out on my own.
But every time I do this my way

3
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,660
I get caught in the lies of the enemy
I lay my troubles down

4
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,780
I'm ready for you now.

5
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,720
Bring me out
come and find me in the dark now

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:55,000
Everyday by myself I'm breaking down
I don't wanna fight alone anymore

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,580
Bring me out
from the prison of my own pride

8
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,480
My God
I need a hope I can't deny

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,180
In the end I'm realizing I was never meant
to fight on my own

10
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,700
Every little thing that I've known is every
thing I need to let go

11
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,260
You're so much bigger than the world I've
made

12
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,480
So I surrender my soul
I'm reaching out for your hope

13
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,140
I lay my weapons down
I'm ready for you now.

14
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,880
Bring me out
come and find me in the dark now

15
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,220
Everyday by myself I'm breaking down

16
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,920
I don't wanna fight alone anymore

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,780
Bring me out
from the prison of my own pride

18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,220
My God
I need a hope I can't deny

19
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,860
In the end I'm realizing I was never meant to fight on my own

20
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,420
I don't wanna be incomplete

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,900
I remember what you said to me

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,100
I don't have to fight alone

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,560
Bring me out
come and find me in the dark now

24
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,920
Everyday by myself I'm breaking down

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,940
I don't wanna fight alone anymore

26
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,360
Bring me out
from the prison of my own pride

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
My God
I need a hope I can't deny

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,340
In the end I'm realizing I was never meant to fight on my own
